Hey there! I'm a data science engineer with a focus on R package and Shiny app development. I graduated from Drexel University in 2019 with a BS in Chemical Engineering, and since then I've honed my skills in data analysis and software development.

Having primarily programmed in pharmacometrics, I have become proficient in NONMEM, PsN/Pirana, and many other R packages commonly used in the industry. I take pride in designing, building, testing, and validating R packages from start to finish. Additionally, I have developed new Shiny widgets using R, HTML, and CSS, and have presented R Shiny, RSConnect, and Git trainings to both colleagues and clients.

My goal is to continue expanding my knowledge base in R package and Shiny app development, while also learning and developing new software in the field. I am dedicated to further developing my skills in data analysis and visualization,  using these skills to create innovative solutions to complex problems. With a keen eye for detail and a passion for excellence, I am confident in my ability to make valuable contributions to any data-driven organization.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy homebrewing (beer, kombucha, wine/hooch, you name it!), karaoke, and converting my apartment into an indoor jungle.
