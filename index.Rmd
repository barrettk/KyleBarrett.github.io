Hey there! I'm a data science engineer specializing in R package and Shiny app development. Building upon my educational background in Chemical Engineering from Drexel University, where I graduated in 2019, I embarked on a journey into data analysis and software development, leveraging invaluable experiences gained from my cooperative education placements.

Having primarily programmed within the context of pharmacometrics, I have become proficient using NONMEM, `PsN`/`Pirana`, and other key R packages commonly used in the industry (`mrgsolve` and `nlmixr` just to name a few). My ability to develop new features and enhance existing packages (such as `bbr`), is greatly influenced by leveraging this background knowledge. I derive genuine satisfaction from the meticulous process of designing, building, testing, and validating R packages from start to finish - it's where my passion truly shines.

While each R package development cycle has been rewarding, I've found myself drawn to crafting interactive solutions, notably R Shiny. Among my unique experiences is the creation of innovative Shiny widgets using R, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, seamlessly integrated into custom apps. Additionally, I've spearheaded the development of an app housing and executing reusable Shiny modules, streamlining processes across multiple projects. Moreover, I've had the privilege of sharing insights through training sessions on R Shiny, RSConnect, and Git, garnering positive feedback from both colleagues and clients alike.

Looking ahead, I aim to further elevate my proficiency in R package and Shiny app development, while exploring fresh avenues in software development. I'm deeply committed to advancing my awareness of data analysis and visualization, harnessing these skills to craft inventive solutions for diverse challenges. With a keen eye for detail and a passion for excellence, I am confident in my ability to make valuable contributions to any data-driven organization.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy homebrewing (beer, kombucha, you name it!), karaoke (I have a sick light setup), and converting my apartment into an indoor jungle.
