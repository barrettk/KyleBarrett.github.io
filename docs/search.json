    "text": "Hey there! I’m a data science engineer specializing in R package and Shiny app development. Building upon my educational background in Chemical Engineering from Drexel University, where I graduated in 2019, I embarked on a journey into data analysis and software development, leveraging invaluable experiences gained from my cooperative education placements.\nHaving primarily programmed within the context of pharmacometrics, I have become proficient using NONMEM, PsN/Pirana, and other key R packages commonly used in the industry (mrgsolve and nlmixr just to name a few). My ability to develop new features and enhance existing packages (such as bbr), is greatly influenced by leveraging this background knowledge. I derive genuine satisfaction from the meticulous process of designing, building, testing, and validating R packages from start to finish - it’s where my passion truly shines.\nWhile each R package development cycle has been rewarding, I’ve found myself drawn to crafting interactive solutions, notably R Shiny. Among my unique experiences is the creation of innovative Shiny widgets using R, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, seamlessly integrated into custom apps. Additionally, I’ve spearheaded the development of an app housing and executing reusable Shiny modules, streamlining processes across multiple projects. Moreover, I’ve had the privilege of sharing insights through training sessions on R Shiny, RSConnect, and Git, garnering positive feedback from both colleagues and clients alike.\nLooking ahead, I aim to further elevate my proficiency in R package and Shiny app development, while exploring fresh avenues in software development. I’m deeply committed to advancing my awareness of data analysis and visualization, harnessing these skills to craft inventive solutions for diverse challenges. With a keen eye for detail and a passion for excellence, I am confident in my ability to make valuable contributions to any data-driven organization.\n\n\nWhen I’m not coding, I enjoy homebrewing (beer, kombucha, you name it!), karaoke (I have a sick light setup), and converting my apartment into an indoor jungle.\nIf you’d like to learn more about my background and skills, check out my software experiences or full CV here.\n\nLast Updated: Sunday February 11, 2024, 12:53 PM EST"

    "text": "Professional Work\nThis section primarily highlights my contributions to published projects. Most client projects have been confidential, and not all of the software I developed is publicly available (especially R shiny apps).\n\nMetrum Research Group\n\nI have contributed to many of the packages found at github.com/metrumresearchgroup, relating to NONMEM model management & submission, data visualization, data summarization and formatting (exported as latex, HTML, RTF, or MS word), software validation, and R shiny.\n\nI have contributed the most to bbr, pmforest, mpn.scorecard, and mrgda, though I have also been closely involved with the development of nmrec.\nEach of these packages bundled together facilitate model development and submission, and are outlined in Metrum’s Expo.\n\nDesigned and personalized R shiny apps for internal tool development and external client needs, usually relating to PKPD simulation.\nDeveloped a shiny app to contain re-usable shiny modules, with the intention of creating more portable shiny code to be used in multiple client projects.\nDeveloped a complex shiny app to sort through and filter a database with interactive visualizations, statistical summaries, and parameterized report generation.\nWorked on client projects within the scope of data assembly, EDA tables and figures, PK simulation, data visualization and report generation.\nHelped validate and write tests for our cloud computing platform, Metworx.\n\n\n\nCertara\n\nCompound Screening Dashboard, which links to other apps I worked on.\nNote that this link may soon be changed. Will publish the offical Certara link when this happens.\nViral Kinetics Model\nI helped develop other apps on Certara’s website using the flexdashboard R package, though I wouldnt count this as R shiny experience given the R package’s simplicity\n\n\n\n\nPersonal Projects & Github Repositories\nThe following repositories illustrate some of my more recent personal coding projects:\n\npythonR: pythonR is an R package that facilitates the seamless integration of Python code and functionality within R environments. Leveraging the reticulate package, pythonR aims to simplify the process of developing Python-based functions in R, making it easier to set up, test, and validate Python code directly within the R environment.\nsongClip: Prototype R package for running a DJ booth! The core clip_song() function runs an R shiny app. The app will allow you to import an audio library, choose a specific song (any audio file of similar size), modify sound settings (crop it, create loops, adjust equalizer settings, alter playback speed, etc.), and then save out the modified song. The hope was to eventually support layering tracks, similar to a DJ booth, but that is quite a whiles away.\n\nNote that the repositories below are from my college days, when I wasn’t nearly as good or organized at coding:). I have additional repositories on my GitHub that feature notably higher code quality, including improved code organization, readability, and conciseness. While most of these are currently set to private, I would be happy to provide access to interested parties on a case-by-case basis.\nI hope to add more personal apps & R packages in the future!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAnaerobic Digestion\n\n\nHomebrewing\n\n\nCustom HTML layouts\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI modeled the anaerobic digestion of hydraulic fracking contaminants for my senior design project (see GitHub). The model contains 40+ PDE's describing the advanced biological process and reactor properties. An R shiny dashboard app was constructed to facilitate the adjustment model parameters and reactor settings, allowing for quick simulations and sensitivity analyses. An full-screen instance of the app is hosted here, but you can view the embedded version below\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWalkthrough\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nHere's an example of one of the apps I made for personal use back in the day (Homebrewing!). I used to use it to help me keep track of all the ingredients I liked, determine proper measurements, and estimate the pricing. Never actually sold any, but was glad I learned my profit margins wouldn't be too great.\nYou can run the app full screen on shinyapps.io or check it out on GitHub\nNote: It looks like some formatting features aren't working too great on shinyapps.io. Choosing not to fix it with my refined knowledge for nostalgia:)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nI have developed R Shiny applications with more sophisticated user interfaces using HTML and CSS style sheets. These apps are designed to look and feel like traditional web applications rather than typical R Shiny interfaces. While the prototype I'm currently sharing is not fully functional, it demonstrates my ability to create modern and polished user interfaces for R Shiny apps."
