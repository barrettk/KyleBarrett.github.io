#### Background

I modeled the anaerobic digestion of hydraulic fracking contaminants for my senior design project (<a href='https://barrettk.github.io/AnaerobicDigestion/' target='_blank'>see GitHub</a>). The model contains 40+ PDE's describing the advanced biological process and reactor properties. An R shiny dashboard app was constructed to facilitate the adjustment model parameters and reactor settings, allowing for quick simulations and sensitivity analyses.
