#### Background

Here's an example of one of the apps I made for personal use back in the day (Homebrewing!). I used to use it to help me keep track of all the ingredients I liked, determine proper measurements, and estimate the pricing. Never actually sold any, but was glad I learned my profit margins wouldn't be too great.

   - **Note:** It looks like some formatting features aren't working too great on `shinyapps.io`, and some dropdowns don't work correctly in the embedded version here. Choosing not to fix it at the moment, though the full screen version should operate a bit more smoothly.
